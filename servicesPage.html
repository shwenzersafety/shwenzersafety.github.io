		<p>I2P2 is the new Safety Buzzword </p>

		<p>So what is it and why do you need to be concerned? </p>

		<p>I2P2 = Injury and Illness Prevention Program </p>

		<p>The term is being used by OSHA to refer to the new rule-making effort which started earlier this year. It requires employers to implement a program that deals with the actual hazards in their particular workplace. This means employers are required to find and fix hazards BEFORE an OSHA inspection or an incident. </p>

		<p>OSHA will be increasing the frequency of its inspections. The watchwords now are inspections, citations and penalties; no longer just "education"! </p>

		<p>What will the rule look like? </p>

		<p>While OSHA has not finalized the design and scope of the new rule, the Agency states that it will build on the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), the Safety and Health Achievement Program (SHARP), standards such as  ANSI/AIHA Z10 and OHSAS 18001, and state run programs that have proven to be effective in improving worker safety and health. </p>

		<p>PREPARE NOW! </p>

		<p>Don't wait to assess your work areas for hazards, even if they don't meet a current specific OSHA standard. Any hazard, regardless of whether it is an OSHA requirement, will have to be addressed under I2P2. </p>

		<p>These actions can help ensure that you are finding hazards in your workplace:</p>

		<ul class="list-group">
			<li class="list-group-item">ASSIGN roles and responsibilities for safety and health throughout the organization.</li>

			<li class="list-group-item">CONDUCT a baseline safety and health survey. Evaluate all work activities and processes for hazards.</li>

			<li class="list-group-item">RE-EVALUATE any changes in processes, materials or machinery.</li>

			<li class="list-group-item">MAKE on-site inspections a part of your routine. </li>

			<li class="list-group-item">IDENTIFY hazards and take corrective action.</li>

			<li class="list-group-item">PROVIDE a hazard reporting system for employees.</li>
